A Colorado Board of Elections employee assigned the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes for each candidate received. 
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
6. Calculate the voter turnout for each county.
7. Calculate the percentage of votes from each county out of the total.
8. Determine the county with the highest turnout.

## Election-Audit Summary

A little time invested into customizing the script can provide on-demand analysis for years to come.  

For example, if we add another column "cities" in the data file, then it will give a deeper analysis than counties. 

Similarly, if this were a federal election, we could use the same script and change the county to states. 

In short, no matter the number of candidates or counties, the script used to perform the Election Audit can be a valuable resourse for the board. I will be more than happy to discuss any further proposal with the board.
